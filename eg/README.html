This is a small collection of demonstrations files on how to use the
MSSQL classes. Some of these were culled from the Sybperl distribution.
You may want to edit them to change user, password or server.
<P>
<B>bcp.pl, bcp.dat - </B> a simple demo on how to use bcp.
<P>
<B>dbschema.10.pl, dbschema.old.pl - </B>
dbschema is supposed to generate a script of a database. I've adapted it from
Sybperl so far that it runs and produces an output. The output is bogus, though,
presumably due to that the system tables in Sybase 10/11 do not look exactly as
those of MSSQL 6.x.
<P>
<B>dbtext.pl - </B>an example on how to use dbwritetext.
<P>
<B>rpctest.pl - </B>an elaborate example on using the RPC routines directly from
Perl. (It <I>is</I> easier to use <A HREF="../docs/mssql-sqllib.html#sql_sp">sql_sp</A>
sp in MSSQL::Sqllib. :-)
<P>
<B>sptritest.bat - </B>
this is actually a useful utilility. (And don't get fooled by the extension.
It's just a Perl script wrapped into a BAT file.)
<P>
 SPTRITEST runs each stored procedure and trigger in a database and
 accesses all views. Nonsens values are used as parameters. SPTRITEST
 reports all errors that occurs. Well almost all, some errors that are
 likely to be due to the nonsense values are filtered away. What
 you should look for are errors that are due to incorrect SQL, for
 instance joins between different user-defined datatypes, errors
 that SQL Server does not detect at CREATE time. Thus, SPTRITEST
 for helping to find problems in your database, before the problems
 find you.
<P>
 WARNING! Don't run SPTRITEST in a database with data you care
 about. SPTRITEST do not try to clean up the nonsense it might
 insert.
<P>
<B>sqllib-simple.pl - </B>a simple example of using the MSSQL::Sqllib module.
<P>
<B>sqllibtest.pl - </B>a script which uses MSSQL::Sqllib in several ways. It used
to be  my test script, before I wrote the real test scripts. You couldn't
say that the script makes much sense, but you might find something.
<P>
<B>statistics.pl - </B>a simple example of a message handler where we catch
messages from SET STATISTICS IO/TIME.
<P>
<B>who.pl - </B>a simple example on a report with MSSQL::DBlib which also shows
how to use MSSQL::DBlib for a simple query. It produces an awful lot of
warnings when run with <KBD>-w</KBD>, though.
